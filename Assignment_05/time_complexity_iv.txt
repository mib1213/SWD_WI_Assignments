The results on time_complexity_iii.py on a random execution look something like this:

list_1 took 0.06256 seconds
set_1 took 0.00036 seconds
list_2 took 0.62577 seconds
set_2 took 0.00063 seconds
list_3 took 3.34658 seconds
set_3 took 0.00098 seconds
list_4 took 7.39562 seconds
set_4 took 0.00060 seconds

This shows that the exact same search operation on the exact same size set is atleast 200 times 
faster as compared to the same search operation on the exact same size list.
