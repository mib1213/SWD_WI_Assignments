The results on time_complexity_iii.py look something like this:

list_1 took 0.06315 seconds
set_1 took 0.00037 seconds
list_2 took 0.06315 seconds
set_2 took 0.00037 seconds
list_3 took 0.06315 seconds
set_3 took 0.00037 seconds
list_4 took 0.06315 seconds
set_4 took 0.00037 seconds

This shows that the exact same search operation on the exact same size set is atleast 200 times 
faster as compared to the same search operation on the exact same size list.
