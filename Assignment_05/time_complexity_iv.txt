The results on time_complexity_iii.py on a random execution look something like this:

list_1 took 0.06279 seconds
set_1 took 0.00040 seconds
list_2 took 0.63702 seconds
set_2 took 0.00069 seconds
list_3 took 3.74154 seconds
set_3 took 0.00102 seconds
list_4 took 7.35889 seconds
set_4 took 0.00066 seconds

This shows that the exact same search operation on the exact same size set is atleast 200 times 
faster as compared to the same search operation on the exact same size list.
